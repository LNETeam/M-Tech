### So how do I set this up? ###

* You can either pastebin the install file, download the install file and put it in a computer, or just download the provided source for install
* Run install.bm, this will OVERWRITE your current system, backup data! Use data merger to transfer data and keep hierarchal integrity.
* Install will require an admin account to be setup. Use a secure password! We can only protect you if you work with us!
* Once installed, you will get a dialog asking to install any popular third party programs (NSPaint, Firewolf, and much more). Select, if any, you want.
* You will be greeted upon reboot, after logging in, with a setup configuration dialog. This is if you want to change the current scheme, you can always change it in the "Settings" application if need be. We will also store the previous two themes, just in case. :)
* You can read about application installation, by issuing help-mtech in the shell or running "About" program in your start menu. This will launch an assistance portal that will have a current guide to the OS and a developer reference included.

### Third Party Integration ###

* If you want to install third party 'programs' its pretty easy. Simply run, "Create" -> "New Install", program and put all the files on a disk, then name your program and install location. This will add a file called, "[application]-install.im". It will ask you of you want to install now. Do what you wish. It can be installed on other computers, and used more than once unless defined in ".im" config
* If you want to install third party APIs simply run, "Create" -> "New API", a windows will appear and simply provide the location of the APIs on the disk, or you can download it from pastebin. Upon creation of a new file, you will be asked is you want to pre-load installed APIs to your program. Just to prevent you from having to import it yourself.
* If you want to run a VO, virtual OS, simply run, "Create" -> "New VO". You will be asked to create a name for your VO and a file directory (resource management coming in the future)
